Question 1

We want to understand more about the movies that families are
watching. The following categories are considered family movies:
Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

SELECT f.title film_title, c.name category_name,
COUNT(*) rental_count
FROM film f
JOIN film_category fc
ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN inventory i
ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN rental r
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN (SELECT c.name
		FROM category c
		WHERE c.name IN ('Animation','Children','Classics','Comedy',
						 'Family','Music'))
GROUP BY f.title, c.name
ORDER BY c.name, f.title;
---

Question 2

Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these
family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies
are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles
and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter,
third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles
(25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all
categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these
family-friendly movies fall into.

SELECT f.title, c.name AS name, f.rental_duration,
NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film f
JOIN film_category fc
ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
WHERE c.name IN (SELECT c.name
		FROM category c
		WHERE c.name IN ('Animation','Children','Classics','Comedy',
						 'Family','Music'));
---
Q3.
Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of
the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each
combination of film category for each corresponding rental
duration category.

WITH t_family_quartile AS (SELECT f.title AS title, c.name AS name, f.rental_duration AS ren_dur,
		NTILE(4) OVER ( ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
		FROM film f
		JOIN film_category fc
		ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
		JOIN category c
		ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
		WHERE c.name IN (SELECT c.name
		FROM category c
		WHERE c.name IN ('Animation','Children','Classics','Comedy',
						 'Family','Music')))

SELECT name, standard_quartile, COUNT(*)
FROM t_family_quartile
GROUP BY name, standard_quartile
ORDER BY name, standard_quartile;
---
Q4.
Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and
year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by
these top 10 paying customers?
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers,
how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007,
and what was the amount of the monthly payments

SELECT
c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS fullname,
DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) AS pay_month,
SUM(p.amount) AS total_payments
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name IN
		(SELECT fullname FROM (SELECT c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS fullname,
		SUM(p.amount) AS tot_amount
		FROM customer c
		JOIN payment p
		ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
		GROUP BY fullname
		ORDER BY tot_amount DESC
		LIMIT 10) top_10 )
GROUP BY pay_month, fullname
ORDER BY fullname, pay_month;
